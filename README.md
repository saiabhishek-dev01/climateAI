# 🌍⚡ Multi-Source ETL Pipeline for Weather & Air Quality Data  

🚀 **A Scalable Data Sciene Pipeline Integrating Multiple APIs to Aggregate Weather & Air Quality Data into PostgreSQL**  

---

## 🏗 Project Overview  
This project is an **end-to-end multi-source ETL pipeline** that **automates the extraction, transformation, validation and loading (ETL) of weather and air quality data** from multiple sources into **PostgreSQL** using **Apache Airflow**.  

This **scalable data pipeline** integrates information from:  
✅ **Open-Meteo API** → Temperature, Wind Speed, Weather Code  
✅ **NOAA API** → Humidity, Precipitation, Wind Speed  
✅ **NASA POWER API** → Solar Radiation, Cloud Coverage  
✅ **IQAir API** → Air Quality Index (AQI), PM2.5, PM10, CO Levels  

🔹 Designed to handle **real-time and historical data**  
🔹 Implements **data validation & consistency checks**  
🔹 Uses **PostgreSQL for structured storage**  
🔹 Fully **automated with Apache Airflow DAGs**
